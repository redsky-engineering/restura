Restura generates fully-functional Express.js endpoints from a JSON schema.

Define your entire API—database tables, routes, request validation, response structure, and authorization—in a single schema file. A companion visual UI lets you create and modify endpoints without writing code, while automatically generating TypeScript types for your request and response objects.

## Why Restura?

Building REST APIs in Node.js typically involves repetitive boilerplate.

Restura eliminates this by generating all of it from a declarative schema.

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Declarative Schema" icon="document">
		Define **what** data you want—tables, columns, joins, where clauses—and Restura handles the **how**.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Zero Boilerplate" icon="rocket">
		No more repetitive route registration, request parsing, or response formatting. Your schema is your API.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Auto-generated SQL" icon="seti:db">
		Generates secure, parameterized SQL queries from your schema definition. No more hand-writing queries.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Built-in Validation" icon="approve-check-circle">
		Validate inputs with `TYPE_CHECK`, `ONE_OF`, and other validators—defined right in your schema.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Role-based Permissions" icon="random">
		Enforce role-based and scope-based permissions declaratively. Authorization is built into the schema.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Custom Logic Escape Hatch" icon="setting">
		Need password hashing or external API calls? Use `CUSTOM_ONE`/`CUSTOM_ARRAY` to drop into Express handlers while
		keeping schema-driven validation.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>
