description: Configuring table and column-level access control in Restura
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Restura supports both table-level and column-level access control using roles and scopes.

:::caution[Important: Empty Arrays Mean Public Access]
Setting `Roles: []` or `Scopes: []` means **PUBLIC ACCESS**, not restricted access. To restrict access, you must specify at least one role or scope. To completely hide sensitive data like passwords, do not include those columns in your schema at all.
:::

## Table-Level Permissions

Control which users can access the entire table.

### Properties

| Property   | Description                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Roles**  | User roles that can query this table |
| **Scopes** | OAuth-style scopes for table access  |

### How It Works

**If a table has roles/scopes defined:**

- Users without the required role/scope cannot query the table
- An error is thrown: "You do not have permission to access this table"
- The query is rejected before any data is accessed

**If a table has no roles/scopes:**

- The table is considered public
- Any authenticated (or unauthenticated) user can access it
- Column-level permissions still apply

---

## Column-Level Permissions

Control which users can see specific columns in responses.

### Properties

| Property   | Description                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Roles**  | User roles that can see this column in responses |
| **Scopes** | OAuth-style scopes for column access             |

### How It Works

**Columns with roles/scopes:**

- Only included in responses if the user has the required access
- Silently excluded if the user lacks permission
- Cannot be used in WHERE clauses by unauthorized users

**Columns without roles/scopes:**

- Included for all users who can access the table
- Can be used in WHERE clauses by anyone

**If a user doesn't have access to any columns:**

- The query fails with a permission error
- At least one column must be accessible

## Permission Examples

### Public Table

```json
Table: product
Roles: []
Scopes: []
```

Anyone can access products. All columns are visible to everyone.

### Admin-Only Table

```
Table: auditLog
Roles: ['ADMIN']
Scopes: []
```

Only admins can access the audit log table.

### Scope-Based Access

```
Table: user
Scopes: ['read:users']
```

Only users with the `read:users` scope can access the user table.

### Hide Sensitive Column

```
Table: user
Roles: []
Scopes: []

Column: socialSecurityNumber
Roles: ['ADMIN', 'HR']
Scopes: []
```

Everyone can access the user table, but only admins and HR can see social security numbers.

### Multiple Permission Levels

```
Table: order
Roles: []
Scopes: []

Column: customerEmail
Roles: ['ADMIN', 'MANAGER']
Scopes: []

Column: internalNotes
Roles: ['ADMIN']
Scopes: []
```

- Everyone can see orders
- Admins and managers can see customer emails
- Only admins can see internal notes

---

## Common Permission Patterns

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

Use global parameters to filter data by company:

```
Table: order
Roles: []
Scopes: []

Endpoint: GET /api/v1/orders
Where: order.companyId = #companyId
```

Users can only see orders from their own company, enforced at the query level.

### Role-Based Column Access

```
Table: employee
Roles: []
Scopes: []

Columns:
  - firstName, lastName: [] (public)
  - email: ['ADMIN', 'HR'] (restricted)
  - salary: ['ADMIN', 'HR'] (restricted)
  - socialSecurityNumber: ['ADMIN', 'HR'] (restricted)
  - performanceReview: ['ADMIN', 'MANAGER'] (restricted)
```

Different roles see different levels of employee information.

### Hierarchical Permissions

```
Table: report
Roles: ['ADMIN', 'MANAGER', 'ANALYST']
Scopes: []

Column: financialData
Roles: ['ADMIN', 'MANAGER']
Scopes: []

Column: confidentialNotes
Roles: ['ADMIN']
Scopes: []
```

- Analysts can see reports but not financial data
- Managers can see financial data but not confidential notes
- Admins can see everything

### Scope-Based API Access

```
Table: user
Scopes: ['read:users']

Column: email
Scopes: ['read:users:email']

Column: phone
Scopes: ['read:users:phone']

Column: address
Scopes: ['read:users:address']
```

Fine-grained OAuth scopes control what data third-party apps can access.

## Permission Enforcement

### Query-Time Filtering

Permissions are enforced when queries are executed:

1. **Table-level check** – Verify user has access to the table
2. **Column filtering** – Remove unauthorized columns from SELECT
3. **WHERE clause validation** – Ensure user can filter by specified columns
4. **Response filtering** – Remove unauthorized columns from results

### Example Query Flow

**User:** Manager with roles `['MANAGER']`

**Query:** `GET /api/v1/users?fields=firstName,email,salary`

**Table permissions:** `[]` (public)

**Column permissions:**

- `firstName`: `[]` (public)
- `email`: `['ADMIN', 'MANAGER']` (restricted)
- `salary`: `['ADMIN', 'HR']` (restricted)

**Result:**

```json
{
	"data": [
		{
			"firstName": "John",
			"email": "john@example.com"
			// salary excluded - user lacks permission
		}
	]
}
```

---

## Combining with Endpoint Permissions

Endpoint permissions and database permissions work together:

### Endpoint Permission

```
Route: GET /api/v1/users
Roles: ['ADMIN', 'MANAGER']
```

Only admins and managers can call this endpoint.

### Database Permission

```
Table: user
Roles: []

Column: salary
Roles: ['ADMIN']
```

Managers can call the endpoint, but only admins can see salary data.

### Result

- Admins see all user data including salaries
- Managers see all user data except salaries
- Other users get a 403 error before querying the database

## Best Practices

### Start with Least Privilege

- Grant minimum necessary permissions
- Add permissions as needed, don't start with full access
- Use table-level permissions for sensitive tables
- Use column-level permissions for PII

### Choose Between Roles or Scopes

Roles and scopes are **mutually exclusive** - you should use one or the other for a given table or column, not both. When evaluating permissions, Restura checks roles first. If no roles are defined, it falls back to checking scopes.

#### Use Roles for Internal Users

```
Roles: ['ADMIN', 'MANAGER', 'USER']
```

Roles are good for internal users with fixed permission levels.

#### Use Scopes for API Access

```
Scopes: ['read:users', 'write:users', 'read:orders']
```

Scopes are good for third-party apps and fine-grained API access.

<Aside type="caution">
	Do not define both roles and scopes on the same resource. If roles are present, scopes will be ignored. Choose the permission model that best fits your use case.
</Aside>

### Document Permission Requirements

Add comments explaining why permissions are set:

```
Table: payroll
Roles: ['ADMIN', 'HR']
Comment: "Contains sensitive salary and tax information"

Column: socialSecurityNumber
Roles: ['ADMIN', 'HR']
Comment: "PII - restricted to authorized personnel only"
```

### Test Permission Scenarios

Test with different user roles to ensure permissions work as expected:

```typescript
// Test as admin
const adminResponse = await fetch('/api/v1/users', {
	headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${adminToken}` }
});
// Should see all columns

// Test as manager
const managerResponse = await fetch('/api/v1/users', {
	headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${managerToken}` }
});
// Should see limited columns

// Test as guest
const guestResponse = await fetch('/api/v1/users', {
	headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${guestToken}` }
});
// Should get 403 error
```

### Audit Permission Changes

Log when permissions are modified:

```typescript
await auditLog.record('permission_changed', {
	table: 'user',
	column: 'salary',
	oldRoles: ['ADMIN'],
	newRoles: ['ADMIN', 'HR'],
	changedBy: currentUser.id,
	timestamp: new Date()
});
```

## Security Considerations

### Never Trust Client Input

Always validate permissions server-side:

```typescript
// Bad: Client specifies which columns to return
const columns = req.query.columns; // Could include unauthorized columns
const users = await db.select(columns).from('user');

// Good: Server enforces column permissions
const users = await db.query.user.findMany({
	// Restura automatically filters columns based on user permissions
});
```

### Use Global Parameters for Data Isolation

```sql
-- Ensure users only see their own company's data
WHERE order.companyId = #companyId
```

This prevents users from accessing other companies' data by manipulating IDs.

### Protect Sensitive Columns

For columns that should never be exposed via the API (like password hashes), you have two options:

**Option 1: Don't include them in your schema (Recommended)**

If a column exists in your database but is not defined in your Restura schema, it will never be accessible through the API.

**Option 2: Use a restricted role that's never assigned**

```
Table: user
Roles: []
Scopes: []

Column: passwordHash
Roles: ['RESTRICTED']
Comment: "Never expose - RESTRICTED role should never be assigned to any user"
```

Create a `RESTRICTED` role in your schema that you never assign to any actual users. This effectively blocks all access to the column.

:::danger[Security Warning]
Setting `Roles: []` or `Scopes: []` means **PUBLIC ACCESS**, not restricted access. An empty array allows everyone to access the column or table.
:::

### Implement Row-Level Security

Combine permissions with WHERE clauses:

```
Table: document
Roles: []

Endpoint: GET /api/v1/documents
Where:
  document.ownerId = #userId
  OR document.isPublic = true
```

Users can only see their own documents or public documents.

## Error Messages

### Table Permission Denied

```json
{
	"error": {
		"code": "FORBIDDEN",
		"message": "You do not have permission to access this table"
	}
}
```

### Column Permission Denied

Columns are silently excluded from results. No error is thrown unless the user has no access to any columns.

### No Accessible Columns

```json
{
	"error": {
		"code": "FORBIDDEN",
		"message": "You do not have permission to access any columns in this table"
	}
}
```
