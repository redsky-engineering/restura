# @restura/internal

Restura is a powerful utility library for building Node.js backend applications with ease. It provides the core functionality to define, validate, and manage your REST API by generating Express.js routes from a schema file. Additionally, it integrates with PostgreSQL databases to handle SQL queries and offers comprehensive authentication and authorization capabilities.

`@restura/internal` is the internal library that contains common utility functions and classes used by the Restura framework. It is not intended to be used directly by developers, but rather serves as a dependency for other Restura packages.
